<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we implemented several techniques for manipulating meshes. The project separates into two parts. In the first part, we implemented Beizier Curves and Beizier Surfaces, which allow us to render the teapot. In the second part, we implemented area-weighted vertex normals to add smooth shading to the mesh. Furthermore, we implemented the edge flip operation and the edge split operation, ultimately leading up to the implmentation of upsampling based on loop subdivision, which gives us a higher-resolution display of mesh. One interesting thing we learned from this assignment is that repeated iterations of loop subdivision can flatten out the sharp corners and edges of the mesh. Doing some pre-processing on the mesh, such as edge splits, can alleviate the effect.

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm to calculate the position of each point on Bezier curves. What we did was to write evaluateStep() first, which calculates one steps of De Casteljau's algorithm and the result will contain one less point than the input. Then the evaluate1D() will call this function until there is only one point. The points like this will form the Bezier curves.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  So in order to calculate the Bezier surfaces, we need a 2D array of control points. So for each row of the control points, we will calculate one Bezier curve (represented as 3D point) using the de Casteljau algorithm (evaluate1D()). Then, once we have an array of 3D points, we can calculate the Bezier surface using the same evaluate1D() function. The result will still be a 3D point. Finally, when rendering, the caller will just need to pass in different u, v values and the result will be the final Bezier surfaces.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  For each given vertex, I will go through all the triangles that connect to this vertex, get their area-weighted normals and sum-up & uniform the result. In order to go through all the triangles that connect to this vertex, I will do one next() and one twin() on the current Half-Edge. To calculate the normal, I do the cross() on two vector (vectors that are formed by current->vertex(), current->next()->vertex() & )current->next()->next()->vertex(). Finally, when we visit the orignal Half-Edge, we are done and we compute the normalized sum.

<b>

<p>
  I extracted all the iterators for all the Half-Edges, Edges, Vertices and Faces. Then, looking at the picture I draw to mark all the iterators, I assigned the corresponding iterators for all the Half-Edges, Edges, Vertices and Faces again (no matter whether they changed or not).

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    Instead of naming the iterators with numbers, I named them with the name of vertices. For example, "ba" is for the Half-Edge from B to A, "e_ba" is the edge between B and A, "a" is the vertex "A" and  "f_abc" is the surface "ABC". 
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  Given an Edge iterator, I first check if the edge is on the boundary. If it is on the boundary, the function returns the vertex of the edge. If not, the function then fetches all the iterators for Half-Edge, Edge, Vertex, and Face for a pair of triangles. In the next step, since the split operation creates new mesh elements, the function creates new iterators for Vertex, Half-Edge, Edge, and Face based on the picture. After that, for each mesh element that shows up in the picture, I set all of its pointers to the correct element (no mattter whether they changed or not). In the final step, the function deletes Face, Half-Edge, and Edge that don't exist in the modified mesh.

    Overall, completing this part is pretty smooth. Drawing the picture of the edge split operation and keeping track of mesh elements, especially new elements created after the operation, has been really helpful to me.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  Basically, in the first step, the function goes through all the vertices in the input mesh. For each vertex, the function calculates its new position based on the loop subdivision rule and stores the position in <code>vertex->newPosition</code>. It also sets <code>vertex->isNew</code> to false to indicate the vertex belongs to the original mesh. In the second step, the function goes through all the edges in the input mesh. For each edge, the function computes the position of the new vertex that will appear in the modified mesh and stores the position in <code>edge->newPosition</code>. The function also sets <code>edge->isNew</code> to false. In the third step, the function splits every edge in the original mesh. It sets <code>isNew</code> (true) and <code>newPosition</code> fields for newly created vertices and sets <code>isNew</code> to true for newly created edges. In the fourth step, the function flips any new edge that connects an old vertex and a new vertex in the modified mesh. In the last step, the function goes through all the vertices again and copy <code>vertex->newPosition</code> to <code>vertex->position</code>.
</p>
<p>
  One interesting implementation trick I have used is that I create an array to store all the edges from the original mesh. Then, I can traverse through this array to split edges, and thus I don't have to worry about messing with newly created edges from the edge split operation. 
</p>
<br>


<b>

  From the three pictures on the first row above, we can see that, as we conduct loop subdivision to the mesh, sharp corners and edges get smoother and eventually flatten out. We can reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges. On the second row of the screenshots above, we perform loop subdivision on the icosahedron with some edge splits. We can see that the smoothing effect is much less on corners and edges that get edge splits.

  The first 6 pictures show the loop subdivision on the original cube. We can see that the cube becomes asymmetric after repeated loop subdivision. To make the cube subdivide symmetrically, for each surface of the cube, I split the diagonal edge on the original cube, so there would be two diagonal edges on each surface of the modified cube. As we can see from the next six pictures shown above, we perform the loop subdivision on the modified cube (with pre-processing). We can see that the modified cube stays symmetrical after repeated loop subdivision. The root problem is that, on each surface of the cube, there's one diagonal edge that creates two triangles, causing vertices to have different degrees. On the surface, two vertices have the degree of 4 while two vertices have the degree of 5. When calculating new positions of vertices in loop subdivision, different degrees lead to asymmetrical new positions, ultimately making the cube asymmetrical after repeated loop subdivision. Splitting every diagonal edge on the cube can help alleviate the effect because, with this operation, every vertex of the cube has the degree of 6. Thus, when performing loop subdivision, the change in the new position of every vertex would be the same, making the cube stay symmetrical after repeated loop subdivsion.
